# Introduction


Two hypothesis: DP as Spec or Phrase.

```{r tree1, echo=FALSE, engine='tikz', out.width='70%', fig.ext=if (knitr:::is_latex_output()) 'pdf' else 'svg', fig.cap='DP and NP phrases', engine.opts = list(template = "latex/tikz2pdf.tex"), fig.align='center'}

\begin{tikzpicture}
	\begin{scope}
		\Tree [ .NP [ .DP D ] [ .N N [ .{...} ] ] ] 
	\end{scope}
	\begin{scope}[xshift=12em]
		\Tree [.root(X) [ .mod(X) head(mod(X)) ] [ .proj(X) head(X) [ .comp(X) ] ] ]
	\end{scope}
	\begin{scope}[yshift=12em]
		\Tree [.DP D [ .NP N [ .{...} ] ] ]
	\end{scope}
	\begin{scope}[yshift=12em, xshift=12em]

# The development of corpus

# Case Study: The usage of DET

## Test

Provide 10 noun phrases with different referential structure in terms of animateness with a neutralized article. The students are invited to write full sentences for each one. 

Goals:

* Test the syntactic distribution of phrases (SUBJ vs OBJ)
* Test the distribution of DETs ([+def], [-def], Ã˜)
