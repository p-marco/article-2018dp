The aim of this paper is to show how this structure is accessed during the learning of Italian, a language which presents the articles as for the standard behavior for nouns. Determiner Phrase, Italian L2, Second Language Acquisition, Syntax 1 Introduction Czech (ces) and Slovak (slk) are languages of the Slavic branch in the Indo-european family. Alongside a certain morphological complexity in noun declension systems, these languages –except for Bulgarian (1.4) and Macedonian (Dryer 2013)– don’t show an overt realization of the Determiner position inside the noun phrase (1.1) (Harkins 1953). Conversly, Italian (ita) and the other romance languages explicit that position as a default behaviour, usually with a free morpheme preceding the noun (1.2) or by cliticization of the definite article (1.3): Articleless Example 1.1 ces (Veselovská 2014, 14) Chlapec/Marie/Ona/každý miluje ryby/ {své rodiče}. Boy/Marie/She/Everyone Love.3sg Fish/ {POSS parent} “SUBJ loves [the] fish/ his parents” slk (Kamenárová 2007, 113) Večer čítam knihy, píšem referatý… Evening Read.1SG Book.PL Write.1SG Paper.PL “In the evening I read [the] books, I write (school) papers …” Proclitic Example 1.2 ita (Bianco 2017, 60) Il terremoto ha distrutto la città.

Where Be.3SG Book=ART.DEF POSS.1SG “Where is my book?” The general idea of this paper is to address the question of how linguistic structures which are not overtly marked in L1 can be accessed during the acquisition of a target language that show them. While doing this can be either both purely speculative as grounded on actual data, I will show how the usage of a target collection of linguistic corpora can be useful to test the main hypotheses into narrower facts. The language under observation are indeed a few: on one side ces and slk as native languages–with no overt position for the articles–on the other ita as target language. The section 2 provides a theoretical discussion on the top of different theories inside the Generative framework (Chomsky 1995) on the status of DP and NP. The section 3 is twofold: firstly I present the methods used into the current analysis in terms of reproducibility of the research, the policies of data-collection and an analysis of the expected results; while the second subsection is built upon a case study made off to test some hypotheses about the categorial differences of DPs during the acquisition of ita by ces and slk native speakers involved in the test. A summary conclusion (Section 4) closes the paper. 2 Theoretical background One of the main area of research in Generative studies on Second Language Acquisition (GenSLA) regards the investigation about how the linguistic structures can be accessed in L2 and how the transitional stages of acquisition work into the learning continuum (Rothman and Slabakova 2017). In this paper I wish to focus on a narrow structure, e.g. the NP-shell. Symmetries amongst the DP/NP phrase and the whole sentence are often ereferenced in terms of structure building and phase-related properties (Chomsky 2013; Chomsky 2015) Figure 2.1: Structural comparison between NP-over-DP and DP-over-NP Hypotheses Two hypothesis: DP as Spec or Phrase. 2.1 Implications for the DP-Hypothesis in Italian 2.2 Implications for the DP-Hypothesis in Czech 3 Case Study 3.1 Retrieve the linguistic data ggplot(df, aes(fill=df$L1, y=abs(rnorm(nrow(df))), x=df$Corpus)) + geom_bar( stat=&quot;identity&quot;) + labs(x=&quot;Corpora&quot;, y=&quot;Number of texts&quot;, color=&quot;Native Language&quot;) Figure 3.1: Number of texts by different Corpora 3.2 Perform a test Provide 10 noun phrases with different referential structure in terms of animateness with a neutralized article. The students are invited to write full sentences for each one. Goals: Test the syntactic distribution of phrases (SUBJ vs OBJ) Test the distribution of DETs ([+def], [-def], Ø) 4 Conclusion Financial coverage This work was partially supported by the funding grant XXX.
