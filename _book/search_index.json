The aim of this paper is to show how this structure is accessed during the learning of Italian, a language which presents the articles as for the standard behavior for nouns. Determiner Phrase, Italian L2, Second Language Acquisition, Syntax 1 Introduction Czech (ces) and Slovak (slk) are languages of the Slavic branch in the Indo-european family. Alongside a certain morphological complexity in noun declension systems, these languages –except for Bulgarian (1.4) and Macedonian (Dryer 2013)– don’t show an overt realization of the Determiner position inside the noun phrase (1.1) (Harkins 1953). Conversly, Italian (ita) and the other romance languages explicit that position as a default behaviour, usually with a free morpheme preceding the noun (1.2) or by cliticization of the definite article (1.3): Articleless Example 1.1 ces (Veselovská 2014, 14) Chlapec/Marie/Ona/každý miluje ryby/ {své rodiče}. Boy/Marie/She/Everyone Love.3sg Fish/ {POSS parent} “SUBJ loves [the] fish/ his parents” slk (Kamenárová 2007, 113) Večer čítam knihy, píšem referatý… Evening Read.1SG Book.PL Write.1SG Paper.PL “In the evening I read [the] books, I write (school) papers …” Proclitic Example 1.2 ita (Bianco 2017, 60) Il terremoto ha distrutto la città.

Where Be.3SG Book=ART.DEF POSS.1SG “Where is my book?” The general idea of this paper is to address the question of how linguistic structures which are not overtly marked in L1 can be accessed during the acquisition of a target language that show them. While doing this can be either both purely speculative as grounded on actual data, I will show how the usage of a target collection of linguistic corpora can be useful to test the main hypotheses into narrower facts. The language under observation are indeed a few: on one side ces and slk as native languages–with no overt position for the articles–on the other ita as target language. The section 2 provides a theoretical discussion on the top of different theories inside the Generative framework (Chomsky 1995) on the status of DP and NP. The section 3 is twofold: firstly I present the methods used into the current analysis in terms of reproducibility of the research, the policies of data-collection and an analysis of the expected results; while the second subsection is built upon a case study made off to test some hypotheses about the categorial differences of DPs during the acquisition of ita by ces and slk native speakers involved in the test. A summary conclusion (Section 4) closes the paper. 2 Theoretical background By a generative-oriented point of view, the human language is a computational procedure which relies on a hierarchical organization of structures, and language variations are reconducted to a parametrizing of choice among them (Adger 2013; Chomsky 1995; Chomsky 1998; Chomsky 2013; Chomsky 2015; Rizzi 2013): We are concerned, then, with states of the language faculty, which we understand to be some array of cognitive traits and capacities, a particular component of the human mind/brain. The language faculty has an initial state, genetically determined; in the normal course of development it passes through a series of states in early childhood, reaching a relatively stable steady state that undergoes little subsequent change, apart from the lexicon. To a good first approximation, the initial state appears to be uniform for the species. (Chomsky 1995) In this perspective, the possibility of comparation is offered either by different languages than among different states of language acquisition: structures can be compared and analized into a coherent grid in order to perform analyses and reveal the similarity and the differences in the parametrizing of syntax. 2.1 The role and the study on interlanguage Amongst many scholar the role of the native language (L1) has been raised as a factor of possible conditionation in the way which the target language (L2) is acquired during the learning path: an emblematic case is the transfer of the knowledge about the structures of the L1 to the target, revealing the intermediate steps of the acquisitional path defined with the term interlanguage (Selinker 1972), that we can refer as to Interlanguage Hypothesis (IlH). One of the main area of research in Generative studies on Second Language Acquisition (GenSLA) regards the investigation about how the linguistic structures can be accessed in L2 and how the transitional stages of acquisition work into the learning continuum (Rothman and Slabakova 2017). Since the last 20 years, a considerable part of linguistic activity is involved in developing some sort of models to describe how the faculty of language can work, in its biological (Hauser, Chomsky, and Fitch 2002), computational (Fodor 2001) and cognitive components in a highly interdisciplinary environment. Studies on SLA is a fertile field, which relies on comparative and contrastive analyses of linguistic phenomena, either both from an applied view (Ellis 1994) than by theoretically grounded perspective focused on GenSLA (Guasti 2002; Hawkins 2001; Rothman and Slabakova 2017; Sorace 2011). 2.2 The position of DP and NP There are striking differencies amongst languages that display an overt D position and those that do not do it in respect to the syntactic behaviour of NP, as such as Left Branch Extraction allowing, scrambling or adjective extraction. Those are properties are summarized in the table below (in Salzmann 2018, from @boskovic2009): Since the seminal work of (Abney 1987) there have been established two hypothesis to represent this structure: (i) NP-over-DP, for which the DP is at the edge of NP as specifier; (ii) DP-over-NP, where the DP dominates the NP: Figure 2.1: Structural comparison between NP-over-DP and DP-over-NP Hypotheses 2.2.1 Implications for the DP-Hypothesis in Italian Symmetries amongst the DP/NP phrase and the whole sentence are often referenced in terms of structure building and phase-related properties (Chomsky 2013; Chomsky 2015). 2.2.2 Implications for the DP-Hypothesis in Czech 3 Case Study 3.1 Retrieve the linguistic data This analysis relies on 3 corpora of Italian L2, subsetted for the current purposes of having Czech and Slovak L1. Figure 3.1: Bi-grams distribution of elements near Nouns 3.2 Perform a test Provide 10 noun phrases with different referential structure in terms of animateness with a neutralized article. The students are invited to write full sentences for each one. Goals: Test the syntactic distribution of phrases (SUBJ vs OBJ) Test the distribution of DETs ([+def], [-def], Ø) 4 Conclusion Financial coverage This work was partially supported by the funding grant XXX.
