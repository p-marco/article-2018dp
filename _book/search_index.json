The aim of this paper is to show how this structure is accessed during the learning of Italian, a language which presents the articles as for the standard behavior for nouns. Determiner Phrase, Italian L2, Second Language Acquisition, Syntax 1 Introduction Czech (ces) and Slovak (slk) are languages of the Slavic branch in the Indo-european family. Alongside a certain morphological complexity in noun declension systems, these languages –except for Bulgarian (1.4) and Macedonian (Dryer 2013 in Dryer and Haspelmath (2013))– don’t show an overt realization of the Determiner position inside the noun phrase (1.1) (Harkins 1953). Conversly, Italian (ita) and the other romance languages explicit that position as a default behaviour, usually with a free morpheme preceding the noun (1.2) or by cliticization of the definite article (1.3): Articlessless Example 1.1 ces (Veselovská 2014, 14) Chlapec/Marie/Ona/každý miluje ryby/ {své rodiče}. Boy/Marie/She/Everyone Love.3sg Fish/ {POSS parent} “SUBJ loves [the] fish/ his parents” slk (Kamenárová 2007, 113) Večer čítam knihy, píšem referatý… Evening Read.1SG Book.PL Write.1SG Paper.PL “In the evening I read [the] books, I write (school) papers …” Proclitic Example 1.2 ita (Bianco 2017, 60) Il terremoto ha distrutto la città.

The students are invited to write full sentences for each one. Goals: Test the syntactic distribution of phrases (SUBJ vs OBJ) Test the distribution of DETs ([+def], [-def], Ø) 4 Conclusion Financial coverage This work was partially supported by the funding grant XXX. Abbreviations Languages are indicated by the abbreviations provided in the ISO 639-3 format (SIL International 2009). Morphological glosses styles adher to the widespreadly recognized Leipzig Glossing Rules (Comrie, Haspelmath, and Bickel 2008), while other abbreviations respect (Boeckx 2012). References "]
