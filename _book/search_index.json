The aim of this paper is to show how this structure is accessed during the learning of Italian, a language which presents the articles as for the standard behavior for nouns. Determiner Phrase, Italian L2, Second Language Acquisition, Syntax 1 Introduction Czech (cs) and Slovak (sk) are languages of the Slavic branch in the Indo-european family. Alongside a certain morphological complexity in noun declension systems, these languages – except for Bulgarian and Macedonian (Dryer 2013 in Dryer and Haspelmath (2013)) – don’t show an overt realization of the Determiner position inside the noun phrase (Harkins 1953). Conversly, Italian (it) and the other romance languages explicit that position as a default behaviour, usually with a free morpheme before the noun – with the exception of Romanian, which uses a intralexematic suffixation on the noun for the article – : Slavic languages (cs, Reference) Viděl jsem Ø/?ten chlapec který běží See.PTCP.PST AUX.1sg DEM Boy.SG pro Run.3sg Romance languages (it, Reference) Ho visto un/il/*Ø ragazzo che corre AUX.1sg See.PTCP.PST DET Boy.SG pro Run.3sg (fr, Reference) J’ai vu un/le/?Ø garçon courir I.AUX.1sg See.PTCP.PST DET Boy.SG Run 2 Theoretical background Two hypothesis: DP as Spec or Phrase.

The students are invited to write full sentences for each one. Goals: Test the syntactic distribution of phrases (SUBJ vs OBJ) Test the distribution of DETs ([+def], [-def], Ø) 4 Conclusion Financial coverage This work was partially supported by the funding grant XXX.
